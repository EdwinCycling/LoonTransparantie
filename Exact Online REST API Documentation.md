Extract API documentation for the resource "LeadPurposes" from the provided HTML.

        *   Markdown format.
        *   Start with `## LeadPurposes`.
        *   Include a "Fields" table with columns: Name, Type, Description.
        *   List supported "Methods".
        *   Concise but accurate.

    *   *Resource Name:* LeadPurposes (from `<h1>Exact Online REST API - LeadPurposes </h1>`).

    *   *Scope:* Crm accounts.
    *   *URI:* `/api/v1/{division}/crm/LeadPurposes`.
    *   *Supported Methods:* The HTML contains radio buttons for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, but specifically displays GET, and the script logic handles others. Looking closely at the provided HTML source, there is only one radio button explicitly rendered: `<input type="radio" name="supportedmethods" value=GET onclick="showMethod()" />GET`. However, common Exact Online resources often support multiple. Let's look at the "Properties" table to see if it implies others.
        *   The properties table has `showpost` and `showput` columns for values.
        *   The radio button section only shows `GET`.
        *   Wait, let's look at the `supportedmethods` radio button section again. It only lists `GET`. However, the script and the table headers mention post/put.
        *   *Self-Correction:* Usually, if only one radio is visible in the provided snippet, I should stick to what's explicitly marked as supported. The snippet says `GET`.
    *   *Fields/Properties:*
        1.  Name: `ID`, Type: `Edm.Guid`, Description: (empty in HTML).
        2.  Name: `Code`, Type: `Edm.String`, Description: `Code`.
        3.  Name: `Description`, Type: `Edm.String`, Description: `Description`.

    *   *Heading:* `## LeadPurposes`
    *   *Summary:* Include the "Good to know" info.
    *   *Endpoint/URI:* `/api/v1/{division}/crm/LeadPurposes`
    *   *Fields Table:*
        | Name | Type | Description |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | ID | Edm.Guid | Primary key |
        | Code | Edm.String | Code |
        | Description | Edm.String | Description |
    *   *Methods:* GET (The HTML only shows GET as an active radio option).

    *   Start with `## LeadPurposes`.
    *   Table columns: Name, Type, Description.
    *   Concise description.

    (Refining the "Methods" part): The HTML only has a radio button for GET. I will list GET.

    (Refining the "Fields" part):
